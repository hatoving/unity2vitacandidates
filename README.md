Here is a list games made in unity that can possibly be ported onto the PS Vita. Some are not checked yet, some may not be portable.
###### Note: Unity 5 games are the most compatible in terms of decompiling and porting.

## Rules
- Game must be made in legacy versions of Unity (pre-2020.x).
- Game must be compiled in Mono. ILL2CPP compiled game may also work, but they take long since the code is more harder to decompile.
- Game must be requested in the Issues page.
- If you can't the game you're looking for, try CTRL+F. If it's not on the list, request it in Issues.

###### Note: Games using beyond the legacy versions **may** be portable, but require way more work and effort. This also goes for games using beyond Unity 5.

## How to request a game
Make sure to mention the game's name and Unity Version when requesting games. You can find out the Unity Version of a game by finding it's file version (not the game version the game tells you). You can do this by clicking on the game's executable file and then hovering over it for a few seconds. You should be able to find it's version there.
