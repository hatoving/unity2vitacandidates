# Unity 2 Vita Candidates
A list of possible Unity ports for the PS Vita. Some are not checked yet.
###### Note: Unity 5 games are the most compatible in terms of porting.

## Rules
- Games must be made in legacy versions of Unity (pre-2020.x). Games beyond the legacy versions **may** be portable, but require way more work and effort.
- Games must be requested in the Issues page
- If you can't the game you're looking for, try CTRL+F. If it's not on the list, request it in Issues
